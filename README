Quantum Simulation of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect

Overview
The simulation evolves the system’s quantum state under a Hamiltonian that depends on the magnetic flux (φ) and visualizes the probabilities of the system being in each of the four basis states over time.

Features
Constructs a 4-state Hamiltonian with phase dependence.
Evolves the quantum state using time evolution operators.
Computes and plots probabilities of each state as a function of time for different values of φ.
Saves plots showing wavefunction evolution for visual inspection.
Outputs Hamiltonian eigenvalues and eigenstates to a text file.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aharonov-bohm-simulation.git
cd aharonov-bohm-simulation

Install dependencies:
pip install qutip matplotlib numpy

Usage
Run the simulation script:
python ab_simulation.py

The script outputs:
Plots: Probability evolution of each basis state for φ = 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π. Saved as 4b1.png … 4b5.png.
Eigenvalues/eigenstates: Saved to eigen_file.txt.
